			<h4>English translation is in progress and may be not accurate</h4>
			<p>It is located between the rivers Cea and Valderaduey, which it shares with other neighboring municipalities as Cea, Grajal 					Campos or Calzada del Coto. It's the main town of the judicial district.
				Located on the plains of the river Cea and Valderaduey, born in the shadow of the Facundo and Primitivo martyrs 				sanctuary and consolidated in the eleventh century with the arrival of the Order of Cluny and the grant of 					jurisdiction to the town by king Alfonso VI. During his reign Sahagún gained importance with the impetus given to the 					pilgrimage route and the introduction into the peninsula cluniacenses rites and uses against the Visigoth, which led 					to increased trade and extended the influence of the town over a large geographic area. After maintaining its 					importance during the Middle Ages, the decline of the town was progressive, accentuating it by the confiscation of 					Mendizabal.
				In 1931 it was the second Spanish town after Eibar (Vasque Country) proclaiming the Second Spanish Republic.
				It's heritage and monuments, and various celebrations taking place throughout the year, most notably Easter, make it a 					site receiving domestic and international tourism. Among its most representative monuments are the Church of San 					Lorenzo, the church of San Tirso, the Sanctuary of the Pilgrim Virgin and the ruins of the Royal Monastery of San 					Benito, all declared of Cultural Interest.

			<br /><br />
			<p>This cultural importance is accentuated by being a place of the Road to Santiago and belonging to the Federation of 					Cluniac Sites. In 2009 the town celebrated the ninth centenary of the death of King Alfonso VI, various commemorative 					activities were carried out like conferences and publications.

			<h2>San Lorenzo church</h2>
			<a href="images/monumentos/grande/san_lorenzo.jpg"><img class="lazy" src="images/bg.png" data-src="images/monumentos/peque/san_lorenzo.jpg" alt="San Lorenzo"/></a>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<p>It's the main church in this town, it has both romanic and mudejar building styles, it was build in the 12nd century.</p>
			<p>It has basilica shape and three main stages, the main one has golden arcs. The tower -next to the absid- was built in the 					14th century, and it has four main areas. Next to the church you'll find the Jesus chapel -Easter Museum-, where the 					biblical statues from Easter celebrations -processions- are showed all the year. </p>
			
			<p>In 2011, the church was seriously damaged, the "Hispania Nostra" group included it in a "red code list" of damaged 					buildings. In 2014, was completely fixed and now one of the must visits at the town.</p>
			<br/>
			
			<h2>San Tirso church</h2>
			<a href="images/monumentos/grande/san_tirso.jpg"> <img class="lazy" src="images/bg.png" data-src="images/monumentos/peque/san_tirso.jpg" alt="San Tirso"/></a>

			<br/>
			<p>Built with romanic-mudejar mixed styles, it was started in the 12nd century, the apse was started usign rock and then 					church was completed using briks, there are another two apses on the side wings but they are already build using 					briks. <br />
			   The main tower has squared shape over the cross area and it has four levels over it. Inside the church there are three 					areas which have a inside-wooden roof.</p>
			<p>This is the most important mudejar style building in Sahagún.</p>
			<br/>
			
			<h2>Sanctuary of Virgen Peregrina</h2>
			<a href="images/monumentos/grande/peregrina.jpg"> <img class="lazy" src="images/bg.png" data-src="images/monumentos/peque/peregrina.jpg" alt="Virgen Peregrina"/></a>

			<br/>
			<p>This sanctuary was build in 1257 as an Franciscan convent after being agreed by the Spanish King Alfonso X in 1245. It was 					completely build using bricks following the "romanic-mudejar" style which today still can see the church and some part 					of the cloister, both of them were fixed many times.</p>
			<p>The church was built with only a main stage but divided in five areas: three capiles, the cross and the absid. We can see 					many old details in the outdoor furniture coming from the south of Spain.
			</p>
			<p>The convent was abanoned in 1835 due to the Mendizábal process in Spain, where many goods from the Catolic church were 					given back to the town.<br />
			This process took place all over the country in this year. After that, the temple was slowly damaged for years.

			<p>During the fixing work, a mummy was found most likely from the 15th century, there are no close clues about who is this 					person, some experts guess that he could be some major monk.</p>

			<br/>
			<p>This monastery was stablished by the Cluny order, it was the main point of the religious transformation which took place at 					León and Castile kingdoms during the 11th century. It's story started with the king Alfonso III when he bought an 					already existent church which contained the relics of saints Facundo and Primitivo to give them to the abad Alonso who 					was running out from Córdoba. </p>

			<br/><br/>
			<p>In 1080, the King Alfonso VI donated it to the Cluny order which started the best years of this monastery, later, when the 					King Alfonso VI died, he was buried here as well as his wives but one. </p>
			<p>In the XV century, the Monastery of San Benito de Valladolid was in charge and it started going down quickly, in 1820 was 					completely closed during the Trienio Liberal years.</p>

			<h4>Remaning parts of the old monastery</h5>

				<p>Formed by one stage divided in three areas -but the last one was lost during years- it was on the north of the 						absid which was built on the 12th century.</p>

				<h5>San Benito arch</h5>
				<a href="images/monumentos/grande/arco.jpg"> <img class="lazy" src="images/bg.png" data-src="images/monumentos/peque/arco.jpg" alt="Arco"/></a>
				<p>Built in 1662 and designed by the architect Felipe Berrojo, it was built to replace the previous one romanic door 					which was already ruined.</p>
				<br /><br />
				<h5>Tower watch</h5>
				<a href="images/monumentos/grande/torre.jpg"> <img class="lazy" src="images/bg.png" data-src="images/monumentos/peque/torre.jpg" alt="Torre"/></a>
				<br/><br/>
				<p>There were two "twin" towers here next to the monastery but only one of them remains standing, later, the City Council installed a big clock on the last one.</p>
				<p>There is some confusing data about the second tower which points to another direction, maybe the second one was started but never completed, but data is not conclusive.
